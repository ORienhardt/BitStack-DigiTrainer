# DigiTrainer

As part of an introduction in digital electronics workshop at VCF SW 2024, I prepared this board. The intent was to reduce lookup time for datasheets and being able to just connect the inputs and outputs of various gates and logic ICs without caring too much about power supplies. In addition, this board features DIP-switches, a toggle and slide switch, hexadecimal switches, LED arrays which do have a built in resistor for current limiting, pull-up and -down resistors, and much more.

In addition to all of that, it includes a section for a Z80 CPU, static memory, and a ROM to be able to learn to program and work with 8-bit CPUs.

## Latest Files

In the "Latest" folder, you'll find the most up-to-date design files, including:

- Gerber files suitable for popular online PCB manufacturers like [PCBWay](/Latest/DigiTrainer_Gerber_PCBWay.zip) and [JLCPCB](/Latest/DigiTrainer_Gerber_JLCPCB.zip). Most manufacturers should be fine with either.
- A Bill of Materials (BOM) in both [CSV](/Latest/DigiTrainer_BOM.csv) and [PDF](/Latest/DigiTrainer_BOM.pdf) formats.
- The [full schematics](/Latest/DigiTrainer_Schematics.pdf) of the board.

## Implementation

The board has been implemented using KiCAD 8. The KiCAD project files are included in this repository.

## How to Use

All inputs of various ICs and gates are on the left side of the indicated gate or IC, while outputs are on the right side of the silkscreen indications. Bi-directional pins are horizontal or on the output side (such as at the Z80 CPU for the data bus).

Many components are already connected to +5V or GND and are indicated by an "arrow up" and "triangle down" respectively. Keep in mind that an LED connected to an IC output with +5V acts as an inverted output due to current sinking.

The top right area also provides a legend of common rules/laws and symbols used in digital electronics (and logic as an extension of it).

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

Below is a list of materials needed to assemble the PCB.
